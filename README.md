# NLU

NLUShop aims to add new functionality to shopping experience that hopes to streamline this process by better augmenting it with NLU (Natural language understanding), in particular to help people who suffer from blindess or short sightetness to conduct their shopping by helping them find what they are looking for when they might be finding it difficult.

I propose to integrate it with Alexa, and the NLU model to be used will be GPT3, which doesn't generally support Arabic, but I found a rather simple solution for that which is to combine it with GCP and AWS for speech recognition, translating when needed, and entity extraction.

See? told you it will come together... still a bit to go, but once it's done it's gonna blow your mind....
Also, why am I assuming you're reading the commits backward, you already saw the finished code and know it's pretty bad :/
