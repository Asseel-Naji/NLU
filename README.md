# NLU

NLUShop aims to add new functionality to shopping experience that hopes to streamline this process by better augmenting it with NLU, in particular to help people who suffer from blindess or short sightetness to conduct their shopping by combining the "research" portion of shopping with the listings.

I propose to integrate it with Alexa, and amazon shop (and other listing websites as well), and the NLU model to be used will be GPT3, which doesn't generally support Arabic, but I found a rather simple solution for that which is to combine it with GCP and AWS for speech recognition, translating when needed, and entity extraction.
