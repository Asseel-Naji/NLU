# Thoughts and prayers

Well, you're not supposed to be reading this, it's not in the final commit. Either way typing helps me think and so here I am again.

So basically I assumed this project will be way easier than it is turning out to be, get gpt3, connect it to an api, then to amazon.com api, get products, explain the products and have fun. But no no no no, it is going nothing like that so far.

First, Amazon don't have an API to query the products that I could find, and I did manage to just scrape them by GETing the possible product names in the url but I was bloced eventually, I am starting to think I should stop trying to scrap the company that's giving me this opportunity lmfao.

I "can" use google, they have a product api, however... c'mon if Amazon is known for anything it is shopping. I can't use google of all things.

Anyway, I was very late to upload, my eyes are watering, I think I read 8 times more than I coded.

I did put up a voice to text service in Jordanian dialect, it's still a mess and not organized into classes, but it's something.

I promise the code will look much better next time I upload.

I know if you're looking at the code at this point it looks sad, as if someone picked up the first google api they could find. But I swear I was trying EVERYTHING that was supposed to happen after, I didn't want my push to be just a lonely api and an api check with gpt3, but alas, it just took me more time.

Just give me a bit.
